# Japanese beef stew

Adapted from NHK’s Dining with the Chef

## Ingredients

    3-4 lb. beef chuck roast, cut into large chunks roughly 3 inches in size
    1 onion, peeled and cut in large chunks
    1 carrot, peeled and cut Iarge chunks
    1 rib of celery, cut in large chunks
    2 garlic cloves, peeled
    1 can of tomatoes (14 oz.)
    100 g tomato paste
    1 cup of sake
    2 tsp. miso
    2 Tbsp. soy sauce
    1/2 cup of olive oil
    1 Tbsp. honey
    1 Tbsp. sugar
    1 cube chicken bouillon
    Salt to taste
    Freshly cooked rice, for serving

## Preparation

In a food processor, drop in the pieces of onion, carrot, celery, garlic cloves, tomato paste and tomatoes with their juices. Pulse until smooth.

In a measuring cup, add sake, miso, soy sauce, honey, sugar, olive oil, chicken bouillon and mix thoroughly.

Place the beef chunks into a heavy pot with a lid, pour over tomato mixture and sake mixture. Stir to combine all ingredients. Bring to a boil, reduce to a low simmer, and cover.

The flame should be kept quite low, with the sauce bubbling gently. Check beef for tenderness after twohours. Remove any very fatty pieces that are quite tender to a bowl and reserve.

Continue to cook until remaining lean pieces are tender, another 1-2 hours. This may depend on the size of your beef chunks, but it’s better to invest the time to make sure all pieces are tender.

Once beef is fork tender, remove to a bowl. Increase heat to reduce the sauce at a medium-high simmer, about 10 minutes. Watch it carefully and stir frequently; don’t let it stick or scorch on the bottom of the pot. Taste sauce for balance and add salt if needed.

If you’re serving it for dinner that night, let the sauce cool slightly and skim off the oil that rises to the surface. Add beef back to pot, turned to coat and warm gently.

For best results, cool down the stew and chill overnight in the fridge. Not only will it taste even better, but the top layer of fat will solidify and can be skimmed off easily.
