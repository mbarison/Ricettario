## Ingredients

    fresh noodles for serving
    
    fresh cucumber as needed, shredded
    carrots as needed, shredded
    white scallion as needed, shredded

    400 g minced pork, or diced pork belly
    1 inch root ginger, finely chopped
    2 cloves garlic, minced
    2-3 tbsp. yellow bean paste
    1-1.5 tbsp. sweet wheat paste
    300 ml warm water
    1 tbsp. cooking wine
    1 tbsp. dark soy sauce
    ½ tsp. sugar

## Preparation

1. Add around 1 tablespoon of cooking oil in pan and fry the diced pork until withered and slightly browned. This is the process why we say it is “fried” sauce. Pour in Chinese cooking wine for a more pure taste. Move the pork to the edges of the pan, add garlic and ginger, fry over slow fire until aromatic. Slow down the fire, otherwise the ginger and garlic might be burnt.
2. Pour in our mixed sauce, dark soy sauce and let it simmer for 15 minutes over slowest fire. Mix in sugar. If necessary, turn up the fire and thicken the sauce slightly.
3. Blanch shredded carrot for around 30 seconds and cook the noodles according to the instruction. Top the sauce and serve immediately. Since this is a dry-mixed noodle dish, I high recommend matching it with a warm soup.
